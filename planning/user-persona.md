   searches of a flexible work time.

## Potential Coach/Mentor

- **Bio**: Erik is an experienced full-stack web developer working for a Dutch
  tech start up. He has 15 years of experience with Javascript, PHP, Python and
  many other languages and skills. He lives in Maastricht and works mostly
  online

- **Needs/Goals**: He wants to share his knowledge and expertise with people who
  are passionate to learn and hopes to work as a peer with them someday. He also
  wants to gain something for himself such as practicing his French or English,
  improving his teaching skills etc.

- **Frustrations**: He feels that being another Youtuber uploading tutorials or
  uploading other online content on educational platforms is not the best way he
  can contribute as there already exist many such learning materials for
  students. He wants to have a more personalized teaching method and to motivate
  the students and respond directly to their issues. However, it's hard for him
  to find an institution that strives towards creating a more personalized
  curriculum for their students rather than trying to maximize their profits. He
  would also prefer to have an easier application process and being able to
  gather feedback about their experience from previous coaches/mentors

- **Scenario 1**: Erik is happy with what he's earning at his tech job and isn't
  necessarily looking for an extra job with extra income that will take up too
  much of his time. He's willing to be an online coach and even attend on campus
  sometimes so he's searching for a flexible position in the Netherlands or
  Belgium to easily apply and receive a swift response so he could get started
  quickly. If he feels it's a big company that will be too rigid with their many
  rules, he will withdraw his application.
